<h2>BanaNAS - home made NAS solution</h2>

<p>
I always want to have own home NAS solution. But projects on market not satisfying my needs.
One day I talked with cooworker about some kinds of Pi machines. He mentioned BananaPi.
BananaPi is not fully opensource hardware but it have: SATA connector, 1Gbit ethernet port, 1GB RAM.
Ultimate features for home made NAS solution. At least for me.

<ul>
